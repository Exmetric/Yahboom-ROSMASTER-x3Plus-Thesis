1. Install Anaconda and VSCode on your windows computer.

2. Open Anaconda, in the terminal run "conda create -n controltest python=3.11" # You can name the file whatever you want, here I chose control test

3. Proceed (y/n)? Enter "y"

4. Run in terminal (in base) "

5. Run in terminal "activate controltest" , you will need to install the required libraries we have used in our python codes and we will do this in our virtual environment so that we dont get contradictions between the versions of the libraries.

The libraries are: keyboard, asyncio, numpy, matplotlib

conda install asyncio
conda install conda-forge::matplotlib
conda install conda-forge::numpy
conda install conda-forge::keyboard

There might be some libraries I have forgotten to mention, but all can be found online how to install. Also I am unsure of asyncio if it needs to be installed manually.

asyncio, json, logging, socket, time, typing, threading, queue, pickle, signal, sys, datetime and struct are all a part of Python's standard library and dont need to be installed separately.


Once the four libraries are installed, you will also need to setup the vpn Netbird.

Instructions for installing and setting up the vpn can be found at netbird.io . You will need to make a free account and setup the Windows PC and the Jetson(linux devices).
Make sure to connect both devices to the netbird vpn before running the codes on the devices (pc and jetson).

You have now successfully set up the windows client side.
