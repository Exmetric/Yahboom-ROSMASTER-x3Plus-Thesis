Step by step procedures for setting up remote VPN Keyboard Control on a new yahboom robot:

1. Have the jetson running and open this github in background.
2. In the jetson, go to filepath: ~/home/jetson/yahboomcar_ws/src/yahboomcar_ctrl/scripts .
3. Make a backup of "yahboom_keybaord.py" as "yahboom_keyboard(copy).py in the scripts folder.
4. Open "yahboom_keyboard.py" with VSCode or gedit. DO NOT OPEN THE COPY.
5. Remove all lines of code.
6. Copy python code from my github "yahboom_keyboard_copy_this.py" .
7. Save it as the original name, as "yahboom_keyboard.py" .

8. After that, in the jetson go to filepath: ~/home/jetson/yahboomcar_ws/src/yahboomcar_ctrl/scripts/ .
9. With VSCode or gedit, create a python file called "keyboard_receiver.py" in the scripts folder.
10. Copy python code from my github "keyboard_receiver.py"
11. Save it as the same name on my github "keyboard_receiver.py".

Now all the scripts and files are in place, we need to run them with ROS.


* 1. Run in the Jetson terminal "roscore", open a new terminal and run "roslaunch yahboomcar_bringup bringup.launch"
* 2. In another terminal run "roslaunch yahboomcar_ctrl yahboom_keyboard.launch"
* 3. On windows client pc, in VSCode run python code "Windows_keyboard_inputs.py" in terminal

You now have control of the robot wheels and servo arm, with a remote computer.


Notes:

- Make sure the ip adresses are correct on both ends of code.

- Make sure that when you are controlling the robot to not type in the programmed code itself, but rather in the terminal of the programme.



Troubleshooting (to be added):

- No connectivity? 
    Make sure the ip adresses and listening/sending ports (local/remote port in codes) are correct on both ends, Jetson and Windows client.
- roslaunch yahboomcar_bringup bringup.launch command gives "Failed to receive IMU message" or similiar?
    Terminate the command with "ctrl + c", and retry the command.
