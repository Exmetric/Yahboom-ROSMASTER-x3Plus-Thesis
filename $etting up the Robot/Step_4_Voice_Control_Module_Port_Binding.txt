- When setting up the robot and connecting the wires as shown in the provided manual, make sure to NOT connect the voice module port (white cable).

- We need to bind the port of the voice module.

- On the yahboom website, they use a raspberry pi for their robot and claim the port binding would be the same with an jetson orin nano.

- Spoiler ahead, it's not. The file names are completely different. They even use a different robot model in the picture. But the process is somewhat the same.

- Check out Yahboom Repo Chapter 30 (Orin-Voice Control Course), Section 2 "Voice control module port binding"

- How I did it: 

1. 


cd etc, cd udev, cd rules.d, sudo gedit serial.rules
