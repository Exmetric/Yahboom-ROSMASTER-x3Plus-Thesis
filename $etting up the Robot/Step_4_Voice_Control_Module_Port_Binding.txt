When setting up the robot and connecting the wires as shown in the provided manual, make sure to NOT connect the voice module port (white cable).
We need to bind the port of the voice module.
On the yahboom website, they use a raspberry pi for their robot and claim the port binding would be the same with an jetson orin nano.
Spoiler ahead, it's not. The file names are completely different. They even use a different robot model in the picture. But the process is somewhat the same.
