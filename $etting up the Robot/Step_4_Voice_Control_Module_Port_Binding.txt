- When setting up the robot and connecting the wires as shown in the provided manual, make sure to NOT connect the voice module port (white cable).

- We need to bind the port of the voice module.

- On the yahboom website, they use a raspberry pi for their robot and claim the port binding would be the same with an jetson orin nano.

- Spoiler ahead, it's not. The file names are somewhat different. They even use a different robot model in the picture. But the process is somewhat the same.

- Check out Yahboom Repo Chapter 30 (Orin-Voice Control Course), Section 2 "Voice control module port binding"

- How I did it: 

1. Follow their instruction on changing the devices serial ID's for the voice port and the myserial.
cd etc, cd udev, cd rules.d, sudo gedit serial.rules
2. You will need to change the serial.rules file, not the ydlidar or rplidar as they say.
3. After changing the file, you will get a confirmed message like serial baudrate opened.

The voice port module will work now, however the cameras will not work.
