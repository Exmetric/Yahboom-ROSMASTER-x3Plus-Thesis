Download Jetpack 5.1.1 img file from the official [Nvidia wesbite](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetpack-sdk-511).

Download any program that can flash a file, like balenaEtcher or RasPi Imager to flash the Sd card. I personally used balenaEtcher.

Run the balenaEtcher, choose your downloaded img file (JetPack 5.1.1) to flash, select your SD card as the target and click flash. Wait for flash and verification.

And you are done.
